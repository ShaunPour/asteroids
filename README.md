This is my recreation project for the Asteroids Arcade game, made using
 Python and Pygame. To play, download the zip, extract to a location of your choosing and then open the folder in the command line after ensuring you 
have python installed. Then, run the command "python3 main.py".

A simpler run method is planned eventually but this is the method for now.
